## Boiler133

This is software for monitoring the water level of a boiler, using a PCBA based on an ESP32. It is based on the [og3](https://github.com/chl33/og3) C++ framework.  The PCBA and project box are shared with the [Room133](https://github.com/chl33/Room133) box.

This uses the [Taidacent Non Contact Water Level Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FC8K28F) on the gauge class of the boiler to detect when the water level in a boiler needs to be refilled.

This is the board used for running the boiler software, which is in the Room133 project.
